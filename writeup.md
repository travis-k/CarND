Project 10 - MPC
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Implement an MPC for a car on a racetrack
* Ensure the car can travel around the track without hitting boundaries

The controller was implemented, and the number of timesteps and timestep size were tuned manually to allow the car to travel a lap of the track without leaving the road.
