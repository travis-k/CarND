Project 10 - MPC
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Implement an MPC for a car on a racetrack
* Ensure the car can travel around the track without hitting boundaries


The controller was implemented as described throughout the lessons. The number of timestep size and timestep duration were tuned manually to allow the car to travel a lap of the track without leaving the road. With smaller or larger dt values, the car behaved erratically at times. The car had some issues in corners with longer timestep sizes.
