Outline of Projects in this Repository
---

Project 1 - Lane Detection
---
https://github.com/travis-k/CarND/tree/P1-Lane_Detection
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road (image or video) using OpenCV
* Summarize the results with a written report

Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classifier
---
https://github.com/travis-k/CarND/tree/P2-Traffic_Sign_Classifier
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

Project 3 - Behavioral Cloning
---
https://github.com/travis-k/CarND/tree/P3-Behavioral_Cloning
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

Project 4 - Advanced Lane Detection
---
https://github.com/travis-k/CarND/tree/P4-Advanced_Lane_Detection
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

Project 5 - Vehicle Tracking
---
https://github.com/travis-k/CarND/blob/P5-Vehicle_tracking/README.md
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
